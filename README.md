When you search a keyword, the application fetches the related
picture from Unsplash API and related articles from New York 
Times API.

This is the repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
